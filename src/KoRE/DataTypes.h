      The data-field is intended for two use-cases:
      1) (For App-Side ShaderInputs): 
        To provide the data that is needed in the shader. This can be anything
        this specific shaderinput needs. 
        In KoRE it is mainly used to pass the attribute-data of meshes to the
        shader (disabled in core-profile) or to provide a byte-offset into a
        VBO (core-profile).
        Texture-type ShaderInputs use it to store a pointer to a textureInfo
        object that holds necessary information about the texture being bound.

      2) (For Shader-Side ShaderInputs):
        (Nothing up til now!)
